Distorted, blended, and bent guitar rips through a wall of tape feedback, evoking thoughts of nostalgia and annihilation. The title takes its name from “Upajjhatthana Sutta: Subjects for Contemplation,” the Buddhist discourse famous for its inclusion of five remembrances – five facts regarding life’s fragility and our true inheritance.

This project was born out of a place of grief and chance. Upon learning that a close friend had passed, the artist was searching through an old hard drive for pictures and remembrances when he found a folder named “clairaudience” from 10 years earlier. While the material from “I will grow different...” is not that exact music, the music that was found was a related body of work which already had a name and finite point of view and would go on to inform this release.</p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"artistData":{"id":"6","slug":"clairaudience-i-will-grow-different","niceName":"clairaudience","featuredSongName":null,"featuredSongUrl":null,"releaseDate":null,"coverArtist":"Marina Galperina","masteredBy":"Stephan Mathieu","producer":null,"bandcampUrl":"https://kshack.bandcamp.com/album/i-will-grow-different-separate-from-all-that-is-dear-and-appealing-to-me-kschk006","soundcloudUrl":"https://soundcloud.com/kschk/sets/clairaudience-i-will-grow-different?utm_source=clipboard\u0026utm_medium=text\u0026utm_campaign=social_sharing","soundcloudPlaylistId":"1390132807","prevArtistSlug":"89.SYM-glyphs-for-second-system","prevArtistLinkText":"89.SYM - Glyphs for Second System","nextArtistSlug":"salem-hilal-bite","nextArtistLinkText":"Salem Hilal - Bite","description":"\"I will grow different, separate from all that is dear and appealing to me” is the first release from American ambient and shoegaze artist clairaudience.
