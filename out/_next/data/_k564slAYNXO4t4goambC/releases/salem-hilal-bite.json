It features three studies in rhythm and club-forward drum programming, as well as \"Ambient Meditation 1\", an exercise on stretching a simple melody over a long arc.\n\nHilal records live hardware performances and strips them down to hard-hitting techno and expansive ambient explorations.\n\nHe has released music on Cultivated Sound and Blank Stairs. His most recent release was on kshack with the techno duo Sleep 300.","albumImage":{"data":null},"albumName":"Bite"}},"__N_SSG":true}
