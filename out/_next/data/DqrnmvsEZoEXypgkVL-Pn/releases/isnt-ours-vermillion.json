The six-track EP includes five disciplined explorations of electro, bass, IDM, and gabber, as well as a sea-change remix courtesy of Moscow-based artists buttechno and Triš.\n\nAn exploration into the primordial and heretical motivations behind creating art, \"Vermilion\" features analogue and digital elements, guitar feedback, found sound, and is indebted to works by Carl Jung, William Blake, Heinrich Khunrath, Editions Mego, and Playboi Carti.\n\nIt was recorded in a windowless basement room in Bed-Stuy, with additional mixing provided by Joe Plourde and mastering by Stephan Mathieu.","albumImage":{"data":null},"albumName":"Vermillion"}},"__N_SSG":true}
