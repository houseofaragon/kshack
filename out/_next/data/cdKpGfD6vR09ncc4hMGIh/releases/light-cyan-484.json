Title track “484” sees Lightcyan’s most accessible track yet, with a warped R&B vocal hook and a shifting synth line that recedes and reappears before you can be sure of exactly what you have just heard. 'Catamaran' and 'Memory’s Heat' bring about a wave of leftfield house, while the EP rounds out with 'Secret Road', a jungle hot rod that conjures images of arcade halls and high speed racing video games of yore. The EP closes with a special remix of 'Near/After' by kshack labelmate dr. buttons.","albumImage":{"data":null},"albumName":"484"}},"__N_SSG":true}
