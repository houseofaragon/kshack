For this new moniker, Sheffield begins with a set of two original EPs, M and 484, which pay homage to downtempo and liquid DnB moods, respectively. First, \"the come up,\" due for an August 25th release date, is M.\n\nM starts with “Deer Park,” an introspective, chugging, ambient house classic. It’s catnip for slow dubbed out DJ sets, with string hits reminiscent of Tangerine Dream. “In Dreams’ Projections” is another DJ tool for those looking to guide a mid tempo journey into psychedelia. The third track, “Anima/Animus” diverges from the more balearic feel of the first two, with an explosive sub bass line hinting at the DnB to come on the next EP. The title track “M,” veers into psybient via dub, conjuring a dissociative state that hovers somewhere between nostalgic trip hop and the unknown. It provides the perfect bedrock for a punishing bass rework via fellow kshack artist 504 Aquatic.","albumName":"M"}},"__N_SSG":true}
