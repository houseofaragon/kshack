It consists of on-grid dance tracks with the drums ripped out, field recordings and single takes, cut-up samples, drones, and autonomic melodies pulled from nostalgic harmonic memories and dreams about extraterrestrials.\n\nRecorded and produced in different contexts over the past year, “Glyphs for Second System” is drum-less music centered on keyboard improvisation and a devotion to studio chance.","albumImage":{"data":null},"albumName":" Glyphs for Second System"}},"__N_SSG":true}
