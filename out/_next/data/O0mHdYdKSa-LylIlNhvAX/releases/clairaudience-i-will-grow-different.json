Distorted, blended, and bent guitar rips through a wall of tape feedback, evoking thoughts of nostalgia and annihilation. The title takes its name from “Upajjhatthana Sutta: Subjects for Contemplation,” the Buddhist discourse famous for its inclusion of five remembrances – five facts regarding life’s fragility and our true inheritance.\n\nThis project was born out of a place of grief and chance. Upon learning that a close friend had passed, the artist was searching through an old hard drive for pictures and remembrances when he found a folder named “clairaudience” from 10 years earlier. While the material from “I will grow different...” is not that exact music, the music that was found was a related body of work which already had a name and finite point of view and would go on to inform this release.","albumImage":{"data":null},"albumName":" I will grow different..."}},"__N_SSG":true}
