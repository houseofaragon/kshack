The duo employ a minimalist approach, fabricating a rich aural tapestry with vocals and a single Korg Volca Beats.\n\nThe EP features a techno remix of “Paranoia” reconstructed by MAL.E (a.k.a. Sweater on Polo) reminiscent of early Robert Hood compositions from his Detroit imprint M-plant.\n\nPurchase of the EP includes a lyrics booklet designed by Chronic Fatigue.","albumImage":{"data":null},"albumName":"Chronic Fatigue"}},"__N_SSG":true}
