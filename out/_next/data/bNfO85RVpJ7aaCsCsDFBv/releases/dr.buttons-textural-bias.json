While the five tracks on the release are distinct explorations, the doctor meticulously sculpts them into a single coherent musical statement that smoothly carves space for remixes by RAMZi and Ronnie Makebelieve. The EP is dr. buttonâ€™s first officially distributed release.\n\ndr. buttons is Joe Plourde. Plourde is a composer, producer, audio engineer, and sound designer who spent years working in music studios and touring in rock bands before transitioning to electronic music production and sound designing professional podcasts (for which he has won a DuPont and been nominated for a Peabody). He loves spending time in the kitchen and trying new things.","albumName":"Textural Bias"}},"__N_SSG":true}
