Distorted, blended, and bent guitar rips through a wall of tape feedback, evoking thoughts of nostalgia and annihilation. The title takes its name from “Upajjhatthana Sutta: Subjects for Contemplation,” the Buddhist discourse famous for its inclusion of five remembrances – five facts regarding life’s fragility and our true inheritance.\nThis project was born out of a place of grief and chance. Upon learning that a close friend had passed, the artist was searching through an old hard drive for pictures and remembrances when he found a folder named “clairaudience” from 10 years earlier. While the material from “I will grow different...” is not that exact music, the music that was found was a related body of work which already had a name and finite point of view and would go on to inform this release.",

First, \"the come up,\" due for an August 25th release date, is M.\nM starts with “Deer Park,” an introspective, chugging, ambient house classic. It’s catnip for slow dubbed out DJ sets, with string hits reminiscent of Tangerine Dream. “In Dreams’ Projections” is another DJ tool for those looking to guide a mid tempo journey into psychedelia. The third track, “Anima/Animus” diverges from the more balearic feel of the first two, with an explosive sub bass line hinting at the DnB to come on the next EP. The title track “M,” veers into psybient via dub, conjuring a dissociative state that hovers somewhere between nostalgic trip hop and the unknown. It provides the perfect bedrock for a punishing bass rework via fellow kshack artist 504 Aquatic.",
